/*
The formula of the sum of two fractions a/b and c/d is
a     c       a * d + b * c
-  +  -   =   -------------
b     d            b * d
For example,
1     2       1 * 3 + 2 * 2   7
-  +  -   =   ------------- = -
2     3           2 * 3       6
Write a program that let the user to enter two fractions
then displays their sum in fractional form. (donï¿½t need to reduce it to lowest terms)
The interaction with the user might look like this:
Enter first fraction: 1/2
Enter second fraction: 2/5
Sum = 9/10
You can take advantage of the fact that the extraction operator can be chained to
read in more than one character at once.
